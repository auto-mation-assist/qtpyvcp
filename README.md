# QtPyVCP: Qt and Python based VCP toolkit for LinuxCNC

QtPyVCP is a PyQt5-based framework for building Virtual Control Panels (VCPs)
for the [LinuxCNC][linuxcnc] machine controller. The goal is to provide a no-code,
drag-and-drop system for making simple VCPs, as well as an easy to use and expand
python framework for building complex VCPs.

QtPyVCP is designed with the philosophy that it is impossible to predict and
satisfy everyones needs, but it _is_ possible to make it easy(er) for people to
satisfy their own needs. Hence QtPyVCP's goal is to pride a rich set of utilities
and basic widgets that can easily be built on, extended and combined, with
minimal (if any) python code to create a fully custom VCP.

## Prerequisites
  * LinuxCNC ~2.8pre (master)
  * Python 2.7
  * Qt 5
  * PyQt 5

## Dependencies

### For production use (non development)
`sudo apt-get install python-pyqt5`  
`sudo apt-get install python-dbus.mainloop.pyqt5`  
Additional dependencies may be needed depending on the particular VCP that is
is being used. These should be listed in the docs for the particular VCP, but if
not the error messages should clearly indicate what packages are missing, and in
most cases will give the exact command for installing the package on Debian based
systems.

### For QtPyVCP and VCP development
`sudo apt-get install qttools5-dev-tools`  
`sudo apt-get install qttools5.dev`  
`sudo apt-get install pyqt5-dev-tools`  
`sudo apt-get install python-pyqt5.qtopengl`  
`sudo apt-get install python-pyqt5.qsci`  

These are required for the camera widget to work:  
`sudo apt-get install python-pyqt5.qtmultimedia`  
`sudo apt-get install gstreamer1.0-plugins-bad`  
`sudo apt-get install libqt5multimedia5-plugins`  

Required for the FileSytem widget:  
`sudo apt install python-pyudev`  
`sudo apt install python-psutil`  


## Development install using setup.py

**Note:** At this point only `setup.py develop` is supported. `setup.py install`
and virtual environments are untested.

Make sure you have the python setuptools installed:  
`sudo apt-get install python-setuptools`

Then install with:
`python setup.py develop --user`

This will install all the python dependences automatically.

This will also generate console scripts in `~/.local/bin/`. This location is
not on the PATH by default on Debian 9, so you will need to add it:  
`export PATH=$PATH:~/.local/bin/`

Them you can launch QtPyVCP simply by saying:  
`qtpyvcp -h` to show the help  
`qtpyvcp --ini=/path/to/ini` to launch a VCP for a running LCNC session  


### Run the development sim

`linuxcnc sim/probe_basic.ini`


## QtDesigner Plug-ins
In order for the QtDesigner plugins to load, you must have the correct version
of `libpyqt5.so` in `/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/qt5/plugins/designer/`. This library
must be compiled for the specific architecture, Qt version and Python version you
are using. One way to get this file is to build PyQt5 from source, following the
procedure here: https://gist.github.com/KurtJacobson/34a2e45ea2227ba58702fc1cb0372c40

If you can find a pre-compiled version, then you should be able simply place it
in `/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/qt5/plugins/designer/` and be good to go. A compiled
 version of `libpyqt5.so` suitable for use on a 64bit Debian stretch system
with Python2.7 and Qt 5.7.1 is included in the QtDesigner directory.
